<h2>Overview & Recommendation</h2>
    <p>
        Chili and the Chocolate Factory (85,356 words) by u/gazemaize is a completed sequel fanfiction of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. 
        Set in the near future in the Roald Dahl-verse, it follows the story of a new Golden Ticket contest held by the now elderly Charlie Bucket. 
        As in the original, Chili comes with wacky kid characters, an even wackier confectionery magnate mastermind, and puns and jokes galore. 
        Unlike the original, it contains metaethical themes, exploration of philosophical and psychological topics like the marshmallow test or the problem of evil, 
        and discussion on the nature of fiction, stories, and puzzles.
