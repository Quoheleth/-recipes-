    <title>Review: Project Hail Mary</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p><em> <a href="https://www.andyweirauthor.com/books/project-hail-mary-hc/project-hail-mary-el" target="_blank">Project Hail Mary</a></em> is more spoiler-prone than most other works, so if you're the sort of person who cares about that sort of thing,
        I'll just tell you it's recommended and you can leave until you finish the book.
        For everyone else- this review consists of two parts: a brief overview with mild spoilers to help potential readers decide if this work is right for them,
         and a more in-depth analysis with moderate but not plot-heavy spoilers.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
       <p> <em>Project Hail Mary</em> (496 pages) is Andy Weir's latest novel. 
        It opens with the protagonist waking up alone in a spaceship with no idea of where he is, what is mission is supposed to be, or even his own name. 
        Needless to say, this makes avoiding spoilers a bit difficult. 
        But I think I've given enough warning to anyone who might care, so I think I can safely describe the premise 
        (i.e. stuff that happens in the first quarter or so, or what might reasonably be shown in a trailer).<sup>1</sup></p>

        <p>The sun has been infected. 
            Swarms of spacefaring alien microbes, called Astrophage, are absorbing significant amounts of its energy output, causing it to dim enough to trigger a new ice age on Earth. 
            Learning that a nearby star, Tau Ceti, has maintained its brightness despite being infected by the Astrophage, the world's governments band together to launch a long-shot mission- 
            a Hail Mary play, if you will- towards the alien system to investigate and transmit back a solution to this stellar plague. 
            Unfortunately but not surprisingly, by the time the ship arrives at Tau Ceti, only the amnesiac Ryland Grace is still alive. 
            However, he's not alone: Project Hail Mary is also a first contact story. I think I'll stop there for now, and hold off on any more details until the analysis section.</p>

        <p><sup>1</sup> [Speaking of trailers, there's a film adaptation in the works, starring Ryan Gosling and directed by Phil Lord & Chris Miller. 
                I am tentatively pretty excited about this; 
                I have liked just about everything I've seen from Lord & Miller, 
                and I can see their style meshing well with Weir's humor.]</p>
